==Using SQL Query ==

SELECT 
  table_id,
  DATETIME(TIMESTAMP_MILLIS(creation_time),"America/New_York") AS creation_time,
  DATETIME(TIMESTAMP_MILLIS(last_modified_time),"America/New_York") AS last_modified_time,
  row_count,
  ROUND(SUM(size_bytes) / (1024*1024*1024), 2) AS size_in_gb,
  ROUND(SUM(size_bytes) / (1024*1024), 2) AS size_in_mb
FROM `your_project.your_dataset.__TABLES__`
GROUP BY
  table_id,
  creation_time,
  last_modified_time,
  row_count

Example:

SELECT
  dataset_id,
  table_id,
  # Convert size in bytes to GB
  ROUND(size_bytes/POW(10,9),2) AS size_gb,
  # Convert creation_time and last_modified_time from UNIX EPOCH format to a timestamp
  TIMESTAMP_MILLIS(creation_time) AS creation_time,
  TIMESTAMP_MILLIS(last_modified_time) AS last_modified_time,
  row_count,
  # Convert table type from numerical value to description
  CASE
    WHEN type = 1 THEN 'table'
    WHEN type = 2 THEN 'view'
  ELSE
  NULL
END
  AS type
FROM
  `bigquery-public-data.ethereum_blockchain`.__TABLES__
ORDER BY
  size_gb DESC;
